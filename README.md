# Test-driving Your Rails Infrastructure with Chef

Managing your infrastructure with configuration management tools like Chef melds the practices of development and operations together. This workshop will focus on a development practice - Test Driven Development - and how that method can be applied to managing your Rails infrastructure and deployments. You will learn how to: Analyze your application and define your infrastructure needs (databases, load balancers, etc.), define unique infrastructure requirements for Rails applications (i.e. asset pipeline), capture your requirements in tests using Test Kitchen, ServerSpec, and other frameworks.

This workshop is being offered at [RailsConf 2015](http://railsconf.com/).
